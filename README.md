Hide Sidebar
====================

Adds a tiny hide button for sidebar of Redmine on larger screens, not when the sidebar is displayed as part of dropdown menu on smaller screens.

Features
====================

 * Using localStorage to remember status of the sidebar (hidden or not) per each page
 * collapsed sidebar leaves 20px which, when hovered, open up the sidebar automatically. It is thus possible to use the sidebar until hovering the extended area, then it will collapse again automatically on exit. Clicking the button again without hovering the sidebar makes it to remain back permanently open

Installation
====================
Change to redmine/plugins folder and run:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/maxrossello/sidebar_hide.git
```
